<title>About OpenStax</title>
<para id="fs-id1165926567633">OpenStax is a nonprofit based at Rice University, and it’s our mission to improve student access to education. Our first openly licensed college textbook was published in 2012, and our library has since scaled to over 35 books for college and AP courses used by hundreds of thousands of students. Our adaptive learning technology, designed to improve learning outcomes through personalized educational paths, is being piloted in college courses throughout the country. Through our partnerships with philanthropic foundations and our alliance with other educational resource organizations, OpenStax is breaking down the most common barriers to learning and empowering students and instructors to succeed.</para>

<title>About <emphasis effect="italics">Intermediate Algebra 2e</emphasis></title>
<para id="fs-id1165926646483"><emphasis effect="italics">Intermediate Algebra 2e</emphasis> is designed to meet the scope and sequence requirements of a one-semester Intermediate Algebra course. The book’s organization makes it easy to adapt to a variety of course syllabi. The text expands on the fundamental concepts of algebra while addressing the needs of students with diverse backgrounds and learning styles. Each topic builds upon previously developed material to demonstrate the cohesiveness and structure of mathematics.</para>

<section id="eip-758"><title>Changes to the Second Edition</title><para id="eip-297">
The <emphasis effect="italics"> Intermediate Algebra 2e</emphasis> revision focused on mathematical clarity and accuracy. Every Example, Try-It, Section Exercise, Review Exercise, and Practice Test item was reviewed by multiple faculty experts, and then verified by authors. This intensive effort resulted in hundreds of changes to the text, problem language, answers, instructor solutions, and graphics.
</para><para id="eip-503">However, OpenStax and our authors are aware of the difficulties posed by shifting problem and exercise numbers when
textbooks are revised. In an effort to make the transition to the 2nd edition as seamless as possible, we have minimized any shifting of exercise numbers. For example, instead of deleting or adding problems where necessary, we replaced problems in order to keep the numbering intact. As a result, in nearly all chapters, there will be no shifting of exercise numbers; in the chapters where shifting does occur, it will be minor. Faculty and course coordinators should be able to use the new edition in a straightforward manner.</para><para id="eip-191">Also, to increase convenience, answers to the Be Prepared Exercises will now appear in the regular solutions manuals, rather than as a separate resource.</para><para id="eip-832">A detailed transition guide is available as an instructor resource at openstax.org.</para></section>

<section id="eip-463"><title>Examples</title><para id="eip-242">Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples, which demonstrate the problem-solving approaches that students must master. Typically, we include multiple examples for each learning objective to model different approaches to the same type of problem, or to introduce similar problems of increasing complexity.</para><para id="eip-170">All examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. First, we pose a problem or question. Next, we demonstrate the solution, spelling out the steps along the way. Finally (for select examples), we show students how to check the solution. Most examples are written in a two-column format, with explanation on the left and math on the right to mimic the way that instructors “talk through” examples as they write on the board in class.</para></section><section id="eip-459"><title>Be Prepared!</title><para id="eip-885">Each section, beginning with Section 2.1, starts with a few “Be Prepared!” exercises so that students can determine if they have mastered the prerequisite skills for the section.
