<solution id="fs-id1167836492374">
<table id="fs-id1167836391994" class="unnumbered unstyled" summary="Step 1 is to read the problem. Determine the types of coins involved. They are pennies and nickels. Create a table. Write in the value of each type of coin. Pennies are worth 1 cent. Nickels are work 5 cents. Step 2 is to identify what we are looking for. We are looking for the number of pennies and nickels. Step 3 is to name or represent the number of each type of coin using variables. The number of nickels is defined in terms of the number of pennies, so start with pennies. Let p be equal to the number of pennies. The number of nickels is three more than eight times the number of pennies. Let the expression 8 p plus 3 be equal to the number of pennies. In the chart, multiply the number and the value to get the total of each type of coin. This chart has two columns and four rows. The first row is a header and it labels the first column “Type” and the second row “Number times Value in dollars is equal to Total Value in dollars.” The first column is a header column and it labels the second row “pennies” and the third row “8 p plus 3.” The second header column is subdivided into three columns for the “number,” “value,” and “total value.” The fourth row only gives the total value of the pennies and nickels. In row 2, the number of pennies p have a value of 0.01 for a total value of 0.01 p. In row 3, the number of nickels 8 p plus 3 have a value of 0.05 for a total value of 0.05 times the quantity 8 p plus 3. In row 4, the total value for the pennies and nickels is 3 dollars and 2 cents. Step 4 is to translate. Write the equation by adding the total value of all the types of coins. The equation is 0.01 p plus 0.05 times the quantity 8 p plus 3 is equal to 2.14. Step 5 is to solve the equation. 0.01 p plus 0.40 p plus 0.15 is equal to 3.02. 0.41 p plus 0.15 is equal to 3.02. 0.41 p is equal to 2.87. p is equal to 7 pennies. How many nickels are there? The expression 8 p plus 3 gives the number of nickels. 8 times 7 plus 3 is equal to 59. There are 59 nickels. Step 6 is to check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense. Jesse has 7 pennies and 59 pennies. Is the total value 3 dollars and 2 cents? Is 7 times 0.01 plus 59 times 0.05 equal to 3.02? 3.02 is equal to 3.02. So, the answers check."><label/>

We are looking for the number of 49 cent stamps and the number of 35 cent stamps. Step 3 is to write variable expressions to represent the number of each type of stamp. Let x be equal to the number of 35 cent stamps. The number of 49 cent stamps was five less than three times the number of 35 cent stamps. Let 3 x minus 5 be equal to the number of 49 cent stamps. This chart has two columns and four rows. The first row is a header and it labels the first column “Type” and the second row “Number times Value in dollars is equal to Total Value in dollars.” The first column is a header column and it labels the second row “49 cent stamps” and the third row “35 cent stamps.” The second header column is subdivided into three columns for the “number,” “value,” and “total value.”  The fourth row only gives the total value of the 49 cent stamps and the 35 cent stamps.

In row 3, the number of 35 cent stamps, x, have a value of 0.35 for a total value of 0.35 x. In row 4, the total value for the 49 cent stamps and the 35 cent stamps is 15 dollars and 75 cents.  Step 4 is to write the equation from the total values. The equation is the sum of 0.49 times the quantity 3 x minus 5 and 0.35 x is equal to 15.75. Step 5 is to solve the equation. 1.47 x minus 2.45 plus 0.35 x is equal to 15.75. 1.82 x minus 2.45 is equal to 15.75. 1.82 x is equal to 18.2. x is equal to 10. There are ten 35 cent stamps. How many 49 cent stamps are there? It is given by the expression, 3 x minus 5. 3 times 10 minus 5 is equal to 25. There are twenty-five 49 cent stamps. Step 6 is to check. Is 10 times 0.35 plus 25 times 0.49 equal to 15.75? Is 3.50 plus 12.25 equal to 15.75? 15.75 is equal to 15.75. Step 7 is to answer the question with a complete sentence.

<table id="fs-id1167836532368" summary="Step 1 is to determine the types of tickets involved. They are full-fare tickets and reduced fare tickets. Step 2 is to identify what we are looking for. We are looking for the number of full-fare passengers and reduced-fare passengers. Step 3 is to name or represent the number of each type of passengers using variables. Let f be equal to the number of full-fare passengers. Then the expression 40 minus f is the number of reduced-fare passengers. We know the total number of passengers was 40. This means the number of full-fare passengers plus the number of reduced-fare passengers must add up to 40. Multiply the number times the value to get the total number of passengers. The chart has two columns and four rows. The first row is a header and it labels the first column “Type” and the second row “Number times Value in dollars is equal to Total Value in dollars.” The first column is a header column and it labels the second row “full-fare passengers” and the third row “reduced-fare passengers.” The second header column is subdivided into three columns for the “number,” “value,” and “total value.” The fourth row only gives the total value of the full-fare passengers and the number of reduced-fare passengers. In row 2, the number of full-fare passengers, f, paid 32 dollars for a total value of 32 f. In row 3, the number of reduced-fare passengers, 40 minus f, paid 26 dollars for a total value of 26 times the quantity 40 minus f. In row 4, the total value for the number of full-fare passengers and the number of reduced-fare passengers. Step 4 is to translate. Write the equation by adding the total values of each type of fare. The equation is 32 f plus 26 times the quantity 40 minus f is equal to 1,196. Step 5 is to solve the equation. 32 f plus 1,040 minus 26 f is equal to 1,196. 6 f is equal to 156. f is equal to 26, which is the number of full-fare passengers. How many reduced-fare passengers are there? It is given by the expression 40 minus f. That is 40 minus 26, which is 14 reduced-fare passengers. Step 6 is to check the answer. There were 26 full-fare passengers who paid 32 dollars each and 14 reduced-fare passengers who paid 26 dollars each. Is the total value 116 dollars? 26 times 32 is equal to 832. 14 times 26 is equal to 364. The total is 1,196, which checks. Step 7 is to answer the question. There were 26 full-fare passengers and 14 reduced-fare passengers." class="unnumbered unstyled can-break"><label/>

Let x be equal to the number of pounds of raisins and 23 minus x be equal to the number of pounds of nuts. As before, we fill in a chart to organize our information. We enter the price per pound for each item. We multiply the number times the value to get the total value. The chart has two columns and four rows.
