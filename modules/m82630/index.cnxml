</list><para id="eip-178">All chapters are broken down into multiple sections, the titles of which can be viewed in the <emphasis effect="bold">Table of Contents</emphasis>.</para></section><section id="eip-758"><title>Changes to the Second Edition</title><para id="eip-297">
The <emphasis effect="italics"> Elementary Algebra 2e</emphasis> revision focused on mathematical clarity and accuracy. Every Example, Try-It, Section Exercise, Review Exercise, and Practice Test item was reviewed by multiple faculty experts, and then verified by authors. This intensive effort resulted in hundreds of changes to the text, problem language, answers, instructor solutions, and graphics.
</para><para id="eip-503">However, OpenStax and our authors are aware of the difficulties posed by shifting problem and exercise numbers when
textbooks are revised. In an effort to make the transition to the 2nd edition as seamless as possible, we have minimized any shifting of exercise numbers. For example, instead of deleting or adding problems where necessary, we replaced problems in order to keep the numbering intact. As a result, in nearly all chapters, there will be no shifting of exercise numbers; in the chapters where shifting does occur, it will be minor. Faculty and course coordinators should be able to use the new edition in a straightforward manner.</para><para id="eip-191">Also, to increase convenience, answers to the Be Prepared Exercises will now appear in the regular solutions manuals, rather than as a separate resource.</para><para id="eip-832">A detailed transition guide is available as an instructor resource at openstax.org.</para></section><section id="eip-825"><title>Key Features and Boxes</title><section id="eip-828"><title>Examples</title><para id="eip-497">Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples that demonstrate the problem-solving approaches that students must master. Typically, we include multiple Examples for each learning objective to model different approaches to the same type of problem, or to introduce similar problems of increasing complexity.</para><para id="eip-186">All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. First, we pose a problem or question. Next, we demonstrate the solution, spelling out the steps along the way. Finally (for select Examples), we show students how to check the solution. Most Examples are written in a two-column format, with explanation on the left and math on the right to mimic the way that instructors “talk through” examples as they write on the board in class.</para></section><section id="eip-85"><title>Be Prepared!</title><para id="eip-372">Each section, beginning with Section 2.1, starts with a few “Be Prepared!” exercises so that students can determine if they have mastered the prerequisite skills for the section. Reference is made to specific Examples from previous sections so students who need further review can easily find explanations. Answers to these exercises can be found in the supplemental resources that accompany this title.</para></section><section id="eip-605"><title>Try It</title><para id="eip-207"><media id="eip-id11714328" alt="try-it">

The first plane shows two lines which intersect at one point. Under the graph it says, “The lines intersect. Intersecting lines have one point in common. There is one solution to this system.” The second x y-coordinate plane shows two parallel lines. Under the graph it says, “The lines are parallel. Parallel lines have no points in common. There is no solution to this system.” The third x y-coordinate plane shows one line. Under the graph it says, “Both equations give the same line. Because we have just one line, there are infinitely many solutions.">
