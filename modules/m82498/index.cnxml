<para id="fs-id1168345433105">When we solved mixture applications with coins and tickets earlier, we started by creating a table so we could organize the information. For a coin example with nickels and dimes, the table looked like this:</para>

Hence the content of the “Number” column times the content of the “Value” column equals the content of the “Total Value” column. In the second row of the table, the “Type” column contains “nickels,” the “Number” column is blank, the “Value” column contains 0.05, and the “Total Value” column is blank.

<title>Solution</title>
<table id="fs-id1167836683869" class="unnumbered unstyled can-break" aria-label="This figure reads, “Step 1. Read the problem. We will create a table to organize the information. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. We are looking for the number of adult tickets and the number of child tickets sold. Step 3. Name. what we are looking for. Let a = the number of adult tickets. Let c = the number of child tickets. A table will help us organize the data. We have two types of tickets, adult and child. Write a and c for the number of tickets. Write the total number of tickets sold at the bottom of the Number column. Altogether 147 were sold. Write the value of each type of ticket in the Value column. The value of each adult ticket is $11. The value of each child tickets is $8. The number of times the value gives the total value, so, the total value of adult tickets is a times 11 and 11 times a , and the total value of child tickets is c times 8 = 8 times c. Fill in the Total Value column.” The table has three rows, with two columns having a fourth row, and four columns. The columns are labeled “Type” and “Number times Value = Total Value.” Under “Type” are “adult” and “child.” Under “Number” are “a,” “c,” and 147. Under “Value” are 11 and 8. Under “Total Value” are 11 times a, 8 times c, and 1302. The figure says, “Altogether the total value of the tickets was $1,302. Step 4. Translate into a system of equations. The Number column and the Total value column give us the system of equations.” The equations are a + c = 147 and 11 times a + 8 times c = 1302. The figure then says, “We will use the elimination method to solve this system. Multiply the first equation by -8.” Thus the equations become -8 times (a + c) = -8 times 147 and 11 times a + 8 times c = 1302. The figure then says, “Simplify and add, then solve for as.” Thus the equations are -8 times a + 8 times c = -1176 and 11 times a + 8 times c = 1302. This yields 3a = 126 or a = 42. The figure then says, “Substitute a = 42 into the first equation, then solve for c.” Thus a + c = 147 becomes 4 + c = 147 or c = 105. The figure says, “42 adult tickets at $11 per ticket makes $462. 105 child tickets at $8 per ticket makes $840. The total receipts are $1302. Step 7. Answer the question. The movie theater sold 42 adult tickets and 105 child tickets.”">

<title>Solution</title>
<table id="fs-id1167829590367" class="unnumbered unstyled can-break" aria-label="This figure says, “Step 1. Read the problem. We will create a table to organize the information. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. We are looking for the number of nickels and the number of quarters. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Let n = the number of nickels. Let q = the number of quarter. A table will help us organize the data. We have two types of coins, nickels and quarters. Write n and q for the number each type of coin. Fill in the value column with the value of each type of coin. The value of each nickel is $0.05. The value of each quarter is $0.25. The number times the value gives the total value, so the total value of the nickels is n times 0.05 = 0.05 times n and the total value of quarters is q times 0.25 = 0.25 times q. Altogether the total value of the coins is $7.30.” The table has four columns and three rows, except for the fourth column which has a fourth row. The columns are labeled, “Type” and “Number times Value = Total Value.” Under “Type” are “nickels” and “quarters.” Under “Number” are n and q. Under “Value” is 0.05 and 0.25. Under “Total Value” are 0.05 times n, 0.25 times q, and 7.30. The figure says, “Step 4. Translate into a system of equations. The total value column gives one equation. 0.05n + 0.25q = 7.30. We also know the number of nickels is six less than three times the number of quarters. Translate to get the second equation. N = 3q – 6. Now we have the system to solve.” The equations are 0.05n + 0.25q = 7.30 and n = 3q - 6. The figure says, “Step 5. Solve the system of equations. We will use the substitution method. Substitute n = 3q -6 into the first equation. Simplify and solve for q.” Thus the equation 0.05n + 0.25q = 7.30 becomes 0.05 times (3q – 6) + 0.25q = 7.3. This becomes 0.15q -0.3 + 0.25q = 7.3 or 0.4q – 0.3 = 7.3. Thus 0.4q = 7.6 or q = 19. The figure then says, “To find the number of nickels, substitute q = 19 into the second equation. Thus, n = 3q – 6 becomes n = 3 times 19 – 6 or n = 51. The figure says, “Check the answer in the problem.” 19 quarter at $0.25 = $4.75 and 51 nickels at $0.05 = $2.25. $4.75 plus $2.25 = $7.30. 3 times 19 – 6 = 51. The figure then says, “Step 7. Answer the question. Priam has 19 quarters and 51 nickels.”">

<table id="fs-id1167836568043" class="unnumbered unstyled can-break" aria-label="This figure says, “Step 1. Read the problem. We will create a table to organize the information. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. We are looking for the number of pounds of nuts and the number of pounds of chocolate chips. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Let s = the number of pound of nuts. Let c = the number of pounds of chips. Carson will mix nuts and chocolate chips to get trail mix. Write in n and c for the number of pounds of nuts and chocolate chips. There will be 20 pounds of trail mix. Put the price per pound of each item in the Value column. Fill in the last column using Number times Value = Total Value.” The table has four columns and four rows. The columns are labeled, “Type,” and “Number of pounds times Value = Total Value.” Under “Type” the rows are labeled, “Nuts,” “Chocolate chips,” “Trail mix.” Under “Number of pounds” are n, c, and 20. Under “Value” are 9.00, 2.00, and 7.60. Under Total Value are 9n, 2c, 7.60 times 20 = 152. The figure says, “Step 4. Translate into a system of equations. We get the equations from the Number and Total Value columns.” The equations are n + c = 20 and 9n + 2c = 153. The figure says, “Step 5. Solve the system of equations. WE will use elimination to solve the system. Multiply the first equation by -2 to eliminate c. Simplify and add. Solve for n.” The equations become -2 times (n + c) = -2 times 20 and 9n + 2c = 152 or -2n -2c = -40 and 9n + 2c = 152. This yields 7n = 112 or n = 16. The figure says, “To find the number of pounds of chocolate chips, substitute n = 16 into the first equations, then solve for c.” Thus the equation n + c = 20 becomes 16 + c = 20 or c = 4. The figure says, “Step 6. Check the answer in the problem. Check 16 + 4 = 20 and 9 times 16 + 2 times 4 = 152. Step 7. Answer the question. Carson should mix 16 pounds of nuts with 4 pounds of chocolate chips to create the trail mix.”">

A figure may help us visualize the situation, then we will create a table to organize the information. Sasheena must mix some of the 25% solution and some of the 50% solution together to get 200 m l of the 40% solution. There are three trapezoids. The first is labeled x and 25%. The second is labeled y and 50%. There are arrows pointing from these two trapezoids to a third which is labeled 40% and 200 m l. The figure says, “Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.

A table will help us organize the data. She will mix x m l of 25% with y m l of 50% to get 200 m l of 40% solution. We write the percents as decimals in the chart. We multiply the number of units times the concentration to get the total amount of sulfuric acid in each solution.” The table has four columns and four rows. The columns are labeled, “Type,” and “Number of units times Concentration % = Amount.” Under “Type” are 25%, 50%, and 40%. Under “Number of units” are x, y, and 200. Under “Concentration %” are 0.25, 0.50, 0.40. Under “Amount” are 0.25x, 0.50y, 0.40 times 200. The figure says, “Step 4. Translate into a system of equations.

Identify what we are looking for. We are looking for the amount to invest in each fund. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Let s = the amount invest in stocks and b = the amount invested in bonds. Write the interest rate as a decimal for each fund. Multiply: Principal times Rate times Time to get the interest.” The table has five columns and four rows. The first row labels each column “Account” and “Principal times Rate times Time = Interest.” Under “Account” is stock fund, bonds, and total. Under “Principal” are s, b, and 40,000. Under “Rate” are 0.08, 0.03, 0.071. Under “Time” are 1 and 1 and nothing. Under “Interest” are 0.08s, 0.03b, and 0.071 times 40,000. The figure says, “Step 4. Translate into a system of equations.
