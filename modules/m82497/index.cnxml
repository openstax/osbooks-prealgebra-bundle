<table id="fs-id1167833386703" class="unnumbered unstyled can-break" aria-label="This figure says, “Step 1. Read the problem. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. We are looking for the ages of Devon and Cooper. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Let d = Devon’s age and c = Copper’s age. Step 4. Translate into a system of equations. Devon is 26 years older than cooper. d = c + 26. The sum of their ages is 50. D + c = 50. The system is: d = c + 26 and d + c = 50. Step 5. Solve the system of equations. Solve by substitution. Substitute c + 26 into the second equation. Solve for c.” Thus d + c = 50 becomes c + 26 + c = 50. This becomes 2c + 26 = 50 which is 2c = 24, or c = 12. The figure then says, “Substitute c =12 into the first equation and then solve for d.” Thus d = c + 26 becomes d = 12 +26 or d = 38. The figure then says, “Step 6. Check the answer in the problem. Is Devon’s age 26 more than cooker’s? Yes 28 is 26 more than 12. Is the sum of their ages 50? Yes, 38 plus 12 is 50. Step 7. Answer the question. Dylan is 38 and Cooper is 12 years old.">

<para id="fs-id1168344525090">When Jenna spent 10 minutes on the elliptical trainer and then did circuit training for 20 minutes, her fitness app says she burned 278 calories. When she spent 20 minutes on the elliptical trainer and 30 minutes circuit training she burned 473 calories. How many calories does she burn for each minute on the elliptical trainer? How many calories does she burn for each minute of circuit training?</para>

<title>Solution</title>
<table id="fs-id1167824652504" class="unnumbered unstyled can-break" aria-label="This figure says, “Step 1. Read the problem. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. We are looking for the number of calories burned each minute on the elliptical trainer and each minute of circuit training. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Let e = number of calories burned per minute on the elliptical trainer and c = the number of calories burned per minute while circuit training. Step 4. Translate into a system of equations. 10 minutes on the elliptical and circuit training for 20 minutes, burned 278 calories. 10e + 20c =278. 10 minutes on the elliptical and 30 minutes of circuit training burned 473 calories. 20e + 30c = 473. The system is 10e + 20c = 278 and 20e + 30c = 473. Step 5. Solve the system of equations. Multiply the first equation by -2 to get opposite coefficients of e. Simplify and add the equations. Solve for c.” The figure then shows that -2 times (10e + 20c) = -2 times 278 plus 2e + 30c = 473 becomes -20e – 40c = -556 plus 20e + 30c = 473. This yields -10c = -83 or c = 8.3. The figure then says, “Substitute c = 8.3 into one of the original equations to solve for e.” Thus 10e + 20c = 278 becomes 10e + 20 times 8.3 = 278 or 10e +166 = 278. Thus 10e – 112 or e = 11.2. The figure then says, “Step 6. Check. the answer in the problem. Check that math on your own.” It then indicates whether 10 times 11.2 + 20 times 8.3 equals 278 and whether 20 times 11.2 plus 30 times 8.3 equals 473. The figure then says, “Step 7. Answer the question. Jenna burns 8.3 calories per minute circuit training and 11.2 calories per minute while on the elliptical trainer.”">

We are looking for the length and width.” The figure also shows a house with a fenced in yard. The figure continues, “Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Let L = the length of the fenced yard and W = the width of the fenced yard. Step 4. Translate into a system of equations. One length and two widths equal 125. L + 2W = 125. The length will be 5 feet more than four times the width. L = 4W + 5. The system is: L + 2W = 125 and L = 4W + 5. Step 5. Solve the system of equations by substitution. Substitute L = 4W +5 into the first equation, then solve for W.” Thus L + 2W = 125 becomes 4W + 5 + 2W = 125 or 6W + 5 = 125. Thus 6W = 120 or W = 20. The figure then says, “Substitute 20 for W in the second equation, then solve for L.” Thus L = 4W +5 becomes L = 4 times 20 +5 or L = 80 + 5. Thus L = 85. The figure then says, “Step 6.

<table id="fs-id1167836390184" class="unnumbered unstyled can-break" aria-label="This image shows the solution to the problem. It has two columns. The first line in the left column reads,  “Identify and name what we are looking for. We know the rates of both Joni and Kelly, and so we enter them in the chart. Next to this in the right column is a chart that has four columns and three rows. The top row reads “Rate times time equals distance. The next row in the chart reads “Joni” in the first column, with 65 under the Rate column and “j” under the time column. In the distance column, it reads “65j”. The next row down reads, “Kelly” in the first column. In the next column, under rate, it has “78” and in the time column, the variable “k”. The distance column reads 78k. The next line down reads “We are looking for the length of time Kelly, “k” and Joni, “j” will each drive.” Since distance equals rate times time, we can fill in the Distance column.  The next line down reads, “Translate into a system of equations. To make the system of equations, we must recognize that Kelly and Joni will drive the same distance.  So, 65j equals 78k. Also, since Kelly left later, her time will be one half hour less than Joni’s time. So, k equals j minus one half.” Below this, it reads, “now we have the system.” In the right column, it shows the system for the equation. K equals j minus one half and under this “65j equals 78k”. Both lines are within curly brackets. The next line down reads, “Solve the system of equations by substitution. Substitute K equals j minus one half into the second equation and then solve for “j”. To the right of this in the next column, is 65j equals 78k. Under this is 65j equals 78 j minus one half in parentheses. Under this, 65j equals 78j minus 39. Under this, negative 13j equals negative 39. Under this, j equals 3. The next line down on the left reads, “To find Kelly’s time, substitute j equals 3 into the first equation, then solve for.” Next to this in the right column, we have k equals j minus one half. Under this, k equals 3 minus one half. Under this, k equals 5 over 2 or two and one half. The next line down on the left reads: “Check the answer in the problem. Joni traveled 3 hours at 65 mph which equals 195 miles. Kelly traveled two and one half hours at 78 miles per hour which equals 195 miles. Yes, they will have traveled the same distance when they meet. Below this reads, “answer the question”. Next to this in the right column, is the answer Kelly will catch up to Joni in two and one half hours. By then, Joni will have traveled 3 hours."><label/><tgroup cols="2">

<para id="fs-id1168343064826">Many real-world applications of uniform motion arise because of the effects of currents—of water or air—on the actual speed of a vehicle.

We are looking for the speed of the ship in still water and the speed of the current. Name what we are looking for. Let s equal the rate of the ship in still water. Let c equal the rate of the current. A chart will help us organize the information. The ship goes downstream and then upstream. Going downstream, the current helps the ship; therefore, the ships actual rate is s plus c. Going upstream, the current slows the ship; therefore, the actual rate is s minus c.” The table has four columns and three rows. The first cell of the first row is empty. The first column labels each row “downstream” and “upstream.” The three columns are labeled “Rate times Time equals Distance.” Under “Rate” are “s plus c” and “s minus c.” Under “Time” are 4 and 5. Under “Distance” are 60 and 60. The figure continues, “Downstream it takes 4 hours. Upstream it takes 5 hours. Each way the distance is 60 miles. Translate into a system of equations. Since rate times time is distance, we can write the system of equations.” The equations are 4 times (s plus c) equals 60 and 5 times (s minus c) equals 60. The figure says, “Solve the system of equations. Distribute to put both equations in standard form, then solve by elimination. Thus the equations become 4s plus 4c equals 60 and 5s minus 5c equals 60. The figure says, “Multiply the top equation by 5 and the bottom equation by 4. Add the equations then solve for s.” Thus the equations become 2s plus 20c equals 300 and 20s minus 20c equals 240. This yields 40s equals 540 or s equals 13.5. The figure then says, “Substitute s equals 13.5 into one of the original equations.” Thus 4 times (s plus c) equals 60 becomes 4 times (13.5 plus c) equals 60 or 54 plus 4c equals 60 or 4c equals 6. Thus 4c equals 1.5. The figure then says, “Check the answer in the problem. The downstream rate would be 13.5 plus 1.5 equals 15 m p h. In 4 hours the ship would travel 15 times 4 equals 60 miles. The upstream rate would be 13.5 minus 1.5 equals 12 m p h. In 5 hours the ship would travel 12 times 5 equals 60 miles. Answer the question. The rate of the ship is 13.5 m p h and the rate of the current is 1.5 m p h.”">
