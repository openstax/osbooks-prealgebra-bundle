</para></section></section><section id="eip-574"><title>About <emphasis effect="italics">Prealgebra 2e</emphasis></title><para id="eip-203"><emphasis effect="italics">Prealgebra 2e</emphasis> is designed to meet scope and sequence requirements for a one-semester prealgebra course. The text introduces the fundamental concepts of algebra while addressing the needs of students with diverse backgrounds and learning styles. Each topic builds upon previously developed material to demonstrate the cohesiveness and structure of mathematics.</para><para id="eip-373">Students who are taking basic mathematics and prealgebra classes in college present a unique set of challenges. Many students in these classes have been unsuccessful in their prior math classes. They may think they know some math, but their core knowledge is full of holes. Furthermore, these students need to learn much more than the course content. They need to learn study skills, time management, and how to deal with math anxiety. Some students lack basic reading and arithmetic skills. The organization of <emphasis effect="italics">Prealgebra</emphasis> makes it easy to adapt the book to suit a variety of course syllabi.</para></section><section id="eip-386"><title>Coverage and Scope</title><para id="eip-974"><emphasis effect="italics">Prealgebra 2e</emphasis> takes a student-support approach in its presentation of the content. The beginning, in particular, is presented as a sequence of small steps so that students gain confidence in their ability to succeed in the course. The order of topics was carefully planned to emphasize the logical progression throughout the course and to facilitate a thorough understanding of each concept. As new ideas are presented, they are explicitly related to previous topics.
</para><list id="eip-992"><item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 1: Whole Numbers</emphasis><newline/><para id="eip-id1166102478472">Each of the four basic operations with whole numbers—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—is modeled and explained. As each operation is covered, discussions of algebraic notation and operation signs, translation of algebraic expressions into word phrases, and the use of the operation in applications are included.</para></item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 2: The Language of Algebra</emphasis><newline/><para id="eip-id1164699857258">Mathematical vocabulary as it applies to the whole numbers is presented. The use of variables, which distinguishes algebra from arithmetic, is introduced early in the chapter, and the development of and practice with arithmetic concepts use variables as well as numeric expressions. In addition, the difference between expressions and equations is discussed, word problems are introduced, and the process for solving one-step equations is modeled.</para></item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 3: Integers</emphasis><newline/><para id="eip-id1164686725741">While introducing the basic operations with negative numbers, students continue to practice simplifying, evaluating, and translating algebraic expressions. The Division Property of Equality is introduced and used to solve one-step equations.</para></item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 4: Fractions</emphasis><newline/><para id="eip-id1164699787880">Fraction circles and bars are used to help make fractions real and to develop operations on them. Students continue simplifying and evaluating algebraic expressions with fractions, and learn to use the Multiplication Property of Equality to solve equations involving fractions.</para></item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 5: Decimals</emphasis><newline/><para id="eip-id1164691071563">Basic operations with decimals are presented, as well as methods for converting fractions to decimals and vice versa. Averages and probability, unit rates and unit prices, and square roots are included to provide opportunities to use and round decimals.</para></item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 6: Percents</emphasis><newline/><para id="eip-id1164693485022">Conversions among percents, fractions, and decimals are explored. Applications of percent include calculating sales tax, commission, and simple interest. Proportions and solving percent equations as proportions are addressed as well.</para></item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 7: The Properties of Real Numbers</emphasis><newline/><para id="eip-id1164689451233">The properties of real numbers are introduced and applied as a culmination of the work done thus far, and to prepare students for the upcoming chapters on equations, polynomials, and graphing. </para></item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 8: Solving Linear Equations</emphasis><newline/><para id="eip-id1164688355072">A gradual build-up to solving multi-step equations is presented. Problems involve solving equations with constants on both sides, variables on both sides, variables and constants on both sides, and fraction and decimal coefficients.</para></item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 9: Math Models and Geometry</emphasis><newline/><para id="eip-id1164701002884">The chapter begins with opportunities to solve “traditional” number, coin, and mixture problems. Geometry sections cover the properties of triangles, rectangles, trapezoids, circles, irregular figures, the Pythagorean Theorem, and volumes and surface areas of solids. Distance-rate-time problems and formulas are included as well.</para></item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 10: Polynomials</emphasis><newline/><para id="eip-id1164689142386">Adding and subtracting polynomials is presented as an extension of prior work on combining like terms. Integer exponents are defined and then applied to scientific notation. The chapter concludes with a brief introduction to factoring polynomials.</para></item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 11: Graphs</emphasis><newline/><para id="eip-id1164689681900">This chapter is placed last so that all of the algebra with one variable is completed before working with linear equations in two variables. Examples progress from plotting points to graphing lines by making a table of solutions to an equation. Properties of vertical and horizontal lines and intercepts are included. Graphing linear equations at the end of the course gives students a good opportunity to review evaluating expressions and solving equations.</para></item></list><para id="eip-178">All chapters are broken down into multiple sections, the titles of which can be viewed in the Table of Contents.</para></section><section id="eip-709"><title>Changes to the Second Edition</title><para id="eip-410">The <emphasis effect="italics">Prealgebra 2e</emphasis> revision focused on mathematical clarity and accuracy. Every Example, Try-It, Section Exercise, Review Exercise, and Practice Test item was reviewed by multiple faculty experts, and then verified by authors. This intensive effort resulted in hundreds of changes to the text, problem language, answers, instructor solutions, and graphics.
</para><para id="eip-idm311127280">However, OpenStax and our authors are aware of the difficulties posed by shifting problem and exercise numbers when textbooks are revised. In an effort to make the transition to the 2nd edition as seamless as possible, we have minimized any shifting of exercise numbers. For example, instead of deleting or adding problems where necessary, we replaced problems in order to keep the numbering intact. As a result, in nearly all chapters, there will be no shifting of exercise numbers; in the chapters where shifting does occur, it will be minor. Faculty and course coordinators should be able to use the new edition in a straightforward manner.</para>
<para id="eip-idm1204500432">Also, to increase convenience, answers to the Be Prepared Exercises will now appear in the regular solutions manuals, rather than as a separate resource.</para>

The learning objectives are listed explicitly at the beginning of each section and are the focal point of every instructional element.
</para></section><section id="eip-23"><title><emphasis effect="italics">Narrative text</emphasis></title><para id="eip-999">
Narrative text is used to introduce key concepts, terms, and definitions, to provide real-world context, and to provide transitions between topics and examples. An informal voice was used to make the content accessible to students.
</para>
<para id="eip-id1164700077484">Throughout this book, we rely on a few basic conventions to highlight the most important ideas:<newline/><list id="eip-369"><item>Key terms are boldfaced, typically when first introduced and/or when formally defined.</item>

</list></para>
</section><section id="eip-132"><title><emphasis effect="italics">Examples</emphasis></title><para id="eip-550">
Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples, which demonstrate the problem-solving approaches that students must master. Typically, we include multiple Examples for each learning objective in order to model different approaches to the same type of problem, or to introduce similar problems of increasing complexity.
</para>
<para id="eip-id1169918306040">All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. First, we pose a problem or question. Next, we demonstrate the Solution, spelling out the steps along the way. Finally (for select Examples), we show students how to check the solution. Most examples are written in a two-column format, with explanation on the left and math on the right to mimic the way that instructors “talk through” examples as they write on the board in class.</para></section><section id="eip-498"><title><emphasis effect="italics">Figures</emphasis></title><para id="eip-25"><emphasis effect="italics">Prealgebra 2e</emphasis> contains many figures and illustrations.
