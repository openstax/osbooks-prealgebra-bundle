<para id="fs-id1168344342341">We have reviewed translating English phrases into algebraic expressions, using some basic mathematical vocabulary and symbols. We have also translated English sentences into algebraic equations and solved some word problems. The word problems applied math to everyday situations. We restated the situation in one sentence, assigned a variable, and then wrote an equation to solve the problem. This method works as long as the situation is familiar and the math is not too complicated.</para>

Restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information. To the right of this, we have The number of girls (11) was three more than twice the number of boys.

Read the problem. Then we have Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. To the right of this, it says that we are looking for two numbers Then we have Step 3. Name. We have two numbers to name, and we need a name for each Choose a variable to represent the number. To the right of this we have n equals the first number. What do we know about the second number? To the right of this, it says that “One number is five more than another.” Hence, n plus 5 equals the second number. Then we have Step 4. Translate. Restate the problem as one sentence with all the important information. To the right of this, we have The sum of the numbers is 21. Then, translate this into an equation, which gives 1st number plus 2nd number equals 21. Below this, we are told to substitute the variable expressions. Hence, n plus n plus 5 equals 21. Then we have Step 5. Solve the equation. To the right of this, we have n plus n plus 5 equals 21. We are told to combine like terms. To the right of this, we have 2n plus 5 equals 21. We are told to subtract 5 from each side and simplify, which gives us 2n equals 16. Then we are told to divide by 2 and simplify, which gives us that n equals 8 as the first number. Then we have to find the second number, which is n plus 5. So the second number is 8 plus 5, which is 13. Then we have Step 6. Check. Do these numbers check in the problem? Below this we are asked is one number 5 more than the other? Under this we have 13 equals with a question mark over it 8 plus 5. Below this we have 13 equals 13 with a check mark next to it.

To the right of this we have x equals the first number. We are told that one number is ten more than twice another. To the right of this, it says that 2x plus 10 equals the second number. Then we have Step 4. Translate. Restate the problem as one sentence. To the right of this, we have Their sum is 1. Below this, we have the sum of the two numbers is 1. Then we have Step 5. Solve the equation. We are told to combine like terms. To the right of this, we have 3x plus 10 equals 1. We are told to subtract 10 from each side, which gives us 3x equals negative 9. Then we are told to divide each side by 3, which gives us that x equals negative 3 as the first number. Then we have to find the second number, which is 2x plus 10. So the second number is 2 times negative 3 plus 10, which is 4. Then we have Step 6. Check. Is ten more than twice negative 3 equal to 4? To the right of this we have 2 times negative 3 plus 10 equals with a question mark over it 4. Below this we have 4 equals 4 with a check mark next to it. Is their sum 1?  To the right of this we have negative 3 plus 4 equals with a question mark over it 1. Below this we have 1 equals 1, with a check mark next to it. Finally, we have Step 7.

It starts with Step 1. Read the problem. Then we have Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. To the right of this, it says that we are looking for three consecutive integers. Then we have Step 3. Name each of the three numbers. To the right of this we have n equals the first number, n plus 1 equals the second consecutive integer, and n plus 2 equals the third consecutive integer. Then we have Step 4. Translate. Restate as one sentence. To the right of this, we have The sum of the three integers is negative 42. Then, translate this into an equation, which gives n plus n plus 1 plus n plus 2 equals negative 42. Then we have Step 5. Solve the equation. To the right of this, we have n plus n plus 1 plus n plus 2 equals negative 42. We are told to combine like terms. To the right of this, we have 3n plus 3 equals negative 42. We are told to subtract 3 from each side. To the right of this, we have 3n equals negative 45. We are told to divide each side by 3, which gives us n equals negative 15 as the first integer. Then we have to find the second integer, which is n plus 1. So the second number is negative 15 plus 1, which is negative 14. Then we have to find the third integer, which is n plus 2. So the third number is negative 15 plus 2, which is negative 13. Then we have Step 6. Check. Under this we have negative 13 plus negative 14 plus negative 15 equals with a question mark over it negative 42. Below this we have negative 42 equals negative 42 with a check mark next to it. Finally, we have Step 7. Answer the question: “The three consecutive integers are negative 13, negative 14, and negative 15.”"><label/><tgroup cols="3">

Choose a variable to represent the amount the husband earns. To the right of this we have h equals the amount the husband earns. It is noted that the wife earns $16,000 less than twice that. Hence, 2h minus 16,000 equals the amount the wife earns. Then we have Step 4. Translate. Restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information. To the right of this, we have together the husband and wife earn $110,000. Below this, we have the amount the husband earns plus the amount the wife earns is $110,000. Then, translate this into an equation, which gives h plus 2h minus 16,000 equals 110,000. Then we have Step 5. Solve the equation. To the right of this, we have h plus 2h minus 16,000 equals 110,000. We are told to combine like terms. To the right of this, we have 3h minus 16,000 equals 110,000. We are told to add 16,000 to each side. To the right of this, we have 3h equals negative 126,000. We are told to divide each side by 3, which gives us h equals 42,000, so $42,000 is the amount the husband earns. Then we have to find the amount the wife earns, which is 2h minus 16,000. So this is 2 times 42,000 minus 16,000, which is 84,000 minus 16,000, which is 68,000. Then we have Step 6. Check. If the wife earns $68,000 and the husband earns $42,000 is the total $110,000? Yes! Finally, we have Step 7. Answer the question: “The husband earns $42,000 a year.”">
