<para id="fs-id1168345424094">We will start by looking at an application everyone is familiar with—money!</para>
<para id="fs-id1168345425869">Imagine that we take a handful of coins from a pocket or purse and place them on a desk. How would we determine the value of that pile of coins? If we can form a step-by-step plan for finding the total value of the coins, it will help us as we begin solving coin word problems.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168345433945">So what would we do? To get some order to the mess of coins, we could separate the coins into piles according to their value. Quarters would go with quarters, dimes with dimes, nickels with nickels, and so on. To get the total value of all the coins, we would add the total value of each pile.</para>

<para id="fs-id1168345367484">How would we determine the value of each pile? Think about the dime pile—how much is it worth? If we count the number of dimes, we’ll know how many we have—the <emphasis effect="italics">number</emphasis> of dimes.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168345542290">But this does not tell us the <emphasis effect="italics">value</emphasis> of all the dimes. Say we counted 17 dimes, how much are they worth? Each dime is worth $0.10—that is the <emphasis effect="italics">value</emphasis> of one dime. To find the total value of the pile of 17 dimes, multiply 17 by $0.10 to get $1.70.

<table id="eip-id1167270965954" class="unnumbered unstyled" aria-label="This table has two columns, with step-by-step instructions in the left column and math in the right column. In the top row, the left column says “Step 1. Read the problem. Determine the type of coins involved. Create a table. Write in the value of each type of coin.” The right column says “Pennies and nickels. Pennies are worth 0.01 dollars. Nickels are worth 0.05 dollars. One row down, the left column says “Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.” The right column says “The number of pennies and nickels.” One row down, the left column says “Step 3. Name. Represent the number of each type of coin using variables. The number of nickels is defined in terms of the number of pennies, so start with pennies. The number of nickels is two more than ten times the number of pennies. Multiply the number and the value to get the total value of each type of coin.” The right column says “Let p equal the number of pennies. 10p plus 2 equals the number of nickels.” Below this is a table. The first row of the table is a header row, and each cell names the column or columns below it. The first cell from the left is named “Type.” The second cell contains the equation “Number” times “Value” equals “Total Value,” with one column corresponding to “Number,” one column corresponding to “Value,” and one column corresponding to total value. Hence the content of the “Number” column times the content of the “Value” column equals the content of the “Total Value” column. In the second row of the table, the “Type” column contains “pennies,” the “Number” column contains p, the “Value” column contains 0.01, and the “Total Value” column contains 0.01p. In the third row of the table, the “Type” column contains “nickels,” the “Number” column contains 10p plus 2, the “Value column contains 0.05, and the “Total Value” column contains 0.05 times the quantity 10p plus 2. One row down, the “Total Value” column contains one more cell, which contains 2 dollars and 14 cents. One row down, the left column says “Step 4. Translate. Write the equation by adding the total value of all the types of coins.” The right column contains the equation 0.01p plus 0.05 times the quantity 10p plus 2 equals 2.14. One row down, the left column says “Step 5. Solve the equation.” The right column contains 0.01p plus 0.50p plus 0.10 equals 2.14. Below this is 0.51p plus 0.10 equals 2.14. Below this is 0.51p equals 2.04. Below this is p equals 4 pennies. One row down, the left column says “How many nickels?” The right column contains 10p plus 2. Below this is 10 times 4 plus 2. Below this is 42 nickels. One row down, the left column says “Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense. Danny has four pennies and 42 nickels. Is the total value 2 dollars and 14 cents?” Below this is 4 times 0.01 plus 42 times 0.05 might equal 2.14. Below this is 2.14 equals 2.14 with a check mark next to it. One row down, the left column says “Step 7. Answer the question.” The right column says “Danny has four pennies and 42 nickels.”">

<title>Solve Mixture Word Problems</title>
<para id="fs-id1168345415724">Now we’ll solve some more general applications of the mixture model. Grocers and bartenders use the mixture model to set a fair price for a product made from mixing two or more ingredients. Financial planners use the mixture model when they invest money in a variety of accounts and want to find the overall interest rate. Landscape designers use the mixture model when they have an assortment of plants and a fixed budget, and event coordinators do the same when choosing appetizers and entrees for a banquet.</para>
