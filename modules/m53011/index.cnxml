<title>Find the Prime Factorization of a Composite Number</title>
<para id="fs-id2692103">In the previous section, we found the factors of a number. Prime numbers have only two factors, the number <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>1</m:mn></m:mrow></m:math> and the prime number itself. Composite numbers have more than two factors, and every composite number can be written as a unique product of primes. This is called the <term>prime factorization</term> of a number. When we write the prime factorization of a number, we are rewriting the number as a product of primes. Finding the prime factorization of a composite number will help you later in this course.</para>

<title>Prime Factorization Using the Factor Tree Method</title>
<para id="fs-id1632121">One way to find the prime factorization of a number is to make a <term class="no-emphasis">factor tree</term>. We start by writing the number, and then writing it as the product of two factors. We write the factors below the number and connect them to the number with a small line segment—a “branch” of the factor tree.</para>
<para id="fs-id1841262">If a factor is prime, we circle it (like a bud on a tree), and do not factor that “branch” any further. If a factor is not prime, we repeat this process, writing it as the product of two factors and adding new branches to the tree.</para>
<para id="fs-id1510405">We continue until all the branches end with a prime. When the factor tree is complete, the circled primes give us the prime factorization.</para>

<table id="eip-id1168468590158" class="unnumbered unstyled" summary="The image shows multiple figures of ladder division. The first figure shows the division of 2 into 120 to get the quotient 60. Two is chosen to divide into 120 because it is the smallest prime number that is a factor of 120. This division is represented using a division bracket with 2 on the outside left of the bracket, 120 inside the bracket and 60 above the 120, outside the bracket. The next figure shows continuing to divide by 2 until it no longer divides evenly. The previous division repeated, but now with another division bracket written around the 60 with a 2 on the outside left of the bracket and a 30 above the 60, outside of the bracket. Since 30 is still divisible by 2 another division bracket is written around the 30 with a 2 on the outside left of the bracket and a 15 above the 30, outside of the bracket. The number 15 is not divisible by 2, but it is divisible by the next prime, 3. The next figure shows the previous figure with another division bracket written around the 15 with a 3 on the outside left of the bracket and a 5 above the 15, outside of the bracket. The quotient 5 is prime, so the ladder is complete.  The prime factorization of the number 120 is made up of all of the numbers from outside of the division brackets which are 2, 2, 2, 3, and 5. The prime factorization can be written as 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 times 5 or using exponents for repeated multiplication of 2 it can be written as 2 to the third power times 3 times 5.">

The second arrow starts at the first 3 in the prime factorization of 15 and continues down through the first 3 in the prime factorization of 18. Ending with the first 3 in the LCM. Since there are no more three's in the prime factorization of 15, the next arrow starts at the second 3 in the prime factorization of 18 and points down to the second 3 in the LCM. Since there are no more factors in the prime factorization of 18, the last arrow starts at the 5 in the prime factorization of 15 and points down to through the empty space at the end of the prime factorization of 18 to the 5 in the LCM. The least common multiple of 15 and 18 is 2 times 3 times 3 times 5 which is 90.">

<table id="eip-id1168466277374" class="unnumbered unstyled" summary="In the figure the prime factorization of 50 is written as the equation 50 equals 2 times 5 times 5. Next to that is the prime factorization of 100 written as the equation 2 times 2 times 5 times 5. Below that is the prime factorization equations of 50 and 100 written to align vertically with the equation for 50 above the equation for 100. These equations are written so that similar prime factors line up vertically. Below this is the prime factorization equations aligned vertically again with a horizontal line drawn under the prime factorization of 100. Below this line is the equation LCM equal to 2 times 2 times 5 times 5. Arrows are drawn down vertically from the prime factorization of 50 through the prime factorization of 100 ending at the LCM equation. Since there is only one 2 in the prime factorization of 50, the first arrow starts at the first 2 in the prime factorization of 100 and points down to the first 2 in the LCM. The second arrow starts at the first 2 in the prime factorization of 50 and continues down through the second 2 in the prime factorization of 100. Ending with the second 2 in the LCM. The next arrow starts at the first 5 in the prime factorization of 50 and continues through the first 5 in the prime factorization of 100. Ending in the first 5 in the LCM. The last arrow starts at the second 5 in the prime factorization of 50 and continues through the second 5 in the prime factorization of 100. Ending in the second 5 in the LCM. The least common multiple of 50 and 100 is 2 times 2 times 5 times 5 which is 100.">
