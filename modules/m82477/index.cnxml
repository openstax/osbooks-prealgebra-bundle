<para id="fs-id1168345274306">When planning a road trip, it often helps to know how long it will take to reach the destination or how far to travel each day.

<para id="fs-id1168345218315">In this section, we will use this formula in situations that require a little more algebra to solve than the ones we saw earlier. Generally, we will be looking at comparing two scenarios, such as two vehicles travelling at different rates or in opposite directions. When the speed of each vehicle is constant, we call applications like this <emphasis effect="italics">uniform motion problems</emphasis>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168345452004">Our problem-solving strategies will still apply here, but we will add to the first step. The first step will include drawing a diagram that shows what is happening in the example. Drawing the diagram helps us understand what is happening so that we will write an appropriate equation.

<para id="fs-id1168345428525">Hamilton loves to travel to Las Vegas, 255 miles from his home in Orange County. On his last trip, he left his house at 2:00 pm. The first part of his trip was on congested city freeways. At 4:00 pm, the traffic cleared and he was able to drive through the desert at a speed 1.75 times as fast as when he drove in the congested area. He arrived in Las Vegas at 6:30 pm.

<para id="fs-id1168345431229">By looking at the diagram below, we can see that the sum of the distance driven in the city and the distance driven in the desert is 255 miles.</para>
<table id="eip-id1167269942174" class="unnumbered unstyled" aria-label="This image shows two columns. In the top right column, it reads, “distance driven in the city plus distance driven in desert equals 255”. When we translate this into an equation, we obtain 2 r plus 2.5 times (1.75r) equals 255. We are told to solve the equation 2 r plus 2.5 times (1.75r) equals 255. Then we have 2 r plus 4.375r equals 255. Then 6.375r equals 255. Then r equals 40 mph in the city. The desert speed is 1.75r; hence, 1.75 times 40 is 70 mph. To check we see that for the city 40 mph times 2 hours equals 80 miles, and for the desert 70 mph times 2.5 hours equals 175 miles. We are told to clear the fractions by multiplying by the LCD of all the fractions in the equation. Summing these two numbers, we obtain 255 miles. Therefore, Hamilton drove 40 mph in the city and 70 mph in the desert.">
